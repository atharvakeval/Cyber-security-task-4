# Cyber-security-task-4

Task: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

What I Did:
I used **Windows Defender Firewall** to:
1. List existing inbound and outbound rules.
2. Add a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
3. Verify the rule was applied by checking firewall settings.
4. Add a rule to allow SSH (Port 22) â€“ for Linux compatibility.
5. Remove the Telnet rule to restore original state.
What I Learned:
- How firewall rules control inbound and outbound traffic
- Difference between blocking and allowing rules
- Why Telnet is insecure and should be blocked
- How to revert firewall changes safely
